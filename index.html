                <h2>Who is Alex?</h2>
                <p>Hi there, I'm Alex Key, a junior in Aerospace Engineering at NC State University. I am currently working towards my Bachelor's and in the midst of a Computer Programming Minor, and I plan to pursue an accelerated Master's degree after graduating.</p>
                <p>I am also the Vice President of NC State's High Powered Rocketry Club, Tacho Lycos, and I lead the experimental subteam in projects where we design and manufacture rockets or new technologies our club hasn't done before. Our current project is building a hobby rocket capable of Mach 3 while staying under 17,000 ft. Outside of meeting times I also lead workshops for the club in design software, common practices in the hobby, and safety guidelines.</p>
                <p>Outside of academics and rocketry, I enjoy drawing, working out, and playing with my dog. While I live in Clayton, North Carolina, I love seeing new places. I'm more passionate about doing what I love than settling down in one place, and I'm always open to wherever the wind takes me.</p>
